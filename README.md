# GitHub User Guide

This guide is to help you understand the typical workflow for working with code hosted on GitHub. For the most part, we have directed towards developers within the University of Florida College of Education, but many of the concepts apply to anyone trying to get started with GitHub. 

## Before You Begin

You will need to complete the following one-time steps before you can interact with GitHub repos:
* Have a GitHub account
* Install Xcode (Only on Mac) 
* Configure your username and email in Git using the following commands in the terminal/command line. Make sure the email is associated with your GitHub account:
    ```git config --global user.name "John Doe"``` 
    ```git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com```

For UF COE Developers Only:
* Request to join the UF-College-of-Education organization on GitHub
